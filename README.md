#   Welcome to the Onion!

This was a summer project create by me! (Ash!)

I wanted to refresh myself in react, apis, and databases over the summer so I thought it would be a perfect time to do something like this

Below are the instructions on how to properly run this server

Note: Password is "password" for admin access, you can change this in the ADMINMODAL.css

## Prerequisite  (stuff you need installed on your machine)

### PgAdmin
I use PostgreSQL for my backend, so you will need a few things from that in order for the website to work

### 1. Login
    Make sure to remember the user and password

### 2. Database 
    Create a new Database (remember this also)

## BackEnd

### 1. Update your db.yml with proper credentials
    Host should stay localhost
    User and password should be your login
    The Database should be the name of the Database you created

### 2. Run pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Run app.py

## FrontEnd 

### 1. cd to the onion directory

### 2. run npm install

### 3. run npm start
